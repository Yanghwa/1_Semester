					<p>Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted
						<strong>coffee beans</strong>, which are the seeds of berries
						from the Coffea plant. The plant is native to subtropical
						Africa and some islands in southern Asia. The plant was
						exported from Africa to countries around the world and
						coffee plants are now cultivated in over 70 countries,
						primarily in the equatorial regions of the Americas,
						Southeast Asia, India, and Africa. The two most commonly
						grown are the highly regarded <em>arabica</em>, and the
						less sophisticated but stronger and more hardy
						<em>robusta</em>. Once ripe, coffee beans are picked,
						processed, and dried. Dried coffee beans are roasted to
						varying degrees, depending on the desired flavor.
						Roasted beans are ground and brewed to produce coffee
						as a beverage.
					</p>
					<p>Coffee is a major export <strong>commodity</strong>: it is the top
						agricultural export for numerous countries and
						among the world's largest legal agricultural export.
						It is one of the most valuable commodities exported by
						developing countries. Green (unroasted) coffee is one of
						the most traded agricultural commodities in the world.
						Some controversy is associated with coffee cultivation and
						the way developed countries trade with developing nations
						and the impact of its cultivation on the environment, in
						regards to clearing of land for coffee-growing and water use.
						Consequently, fair trade coffee and organic coffee are an
						<em>expanding market.</em>

					<h2>The Benefit of Coffee</h2>
					<figure>

						<figcaption>10 Benefit of Coffee</figcaption>
					</figure>
					<p>When consumed in moderation, caffeine has mostly
						positive effects, mainly on alertness, well-being
						and both intellectual and physical endurance performance.
						Caffeine is a mild central nervous stimulant and lifelong
						caffeine consumption may decrease the risk of pathological
						conditions such as age-related cognitive decline, <q>Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease</q>.
						Caffeine does not seem to have significant adverse
						effects on cardiovascular function. Caffeine was shown
						not to lead to dehydration or to significantly affect
						bone health or gastro-intestinal functions.
					</p>
					<p>In most people, moderate caffeine consumption, of around
						400 mg caffeine or equivalent of up to 5 cups of coffee
						per day, can be enjoyed as part of a healthy balanced
						diet and an active lifestyle. Lower levels are recommended
						for pregnant women who are advised to limit caffeine intake
						to 200mg from all sources, as well as in children where the
						intake should be reduced because of lower body weight.
						However, it is important to note that the individual reactions
						to caffeine may differ according to genetic variability
						and that individuals are advised to consume the amount of
						caffeine they feel comfortable with. Those who feel undesired
						effects should consult their physician.
